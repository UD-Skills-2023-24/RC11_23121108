Hi everyone!
The "Julian" folder store the python  assignment.
The "Joris" folder store the Houdini assignment.
The "Ceel" folder store the original file of my complexity assignment's answer.
If there are any supplementary files, I have also explained them in the readme.md file in the corresponding folder.
